Damn it! I'm don't know what I think about when I see some lovely girls. I'm so easy to fall in love with someone. And also have lots of illusion. I always feel a girl maybe love me if she looks at me a lot, although the same to everyone. If someone asked me who is my first crush, I would answer I dont know :) Because I dont remember. But its maybe CHang, my childhood friend. But now we are not friending anymore because we are not in the related in secondary school. I was really sorry about that.

I hope it may be more meticulous in the future. More confident, more attractive and more energetic and I will give to my ex regret because I have done with me.

Vocab and 
Fall in love with
